# Kindergarten Race - Educational Game PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Create an engaging, competitive educational racing game where two players race their turtles by correctly identifying falling objects.
- **Success Indicators**: Smooth 60fps performance, responsive touch controls, and immediate visual feedback that keeps young learners engaged.
- **Experience Qualities**: Playful, responsive, educational

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Interacting (competitive gameplay with educational content)

## Performance Optimizations (Latest Update)

### Target Release System
- **Optimized Spawn Rate**: 350ms intervals for smooth performance as requested
- **Batch Spawning**: 2-4 objects spawn together for better density without performance degradation
- **Smart Throttling**: Maximum 20 objects on screen to prevent bottlenecks
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Uses browser's optimized animation loop instead of setInterval

### Event Tracking & Diagnostics
- **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Tracks frame rate, spawn rate, and touch latency
- **Error Detection**: Automatic capture of JavaScript errors and performance warnings
- **Debug Interface**: Toggle-able debug panel showing performance metrics and event logs
- **Performance Alerts**: Warns when spawn rate exceeds optimal thresholds (>10/sec)

### Technical Performance Features
- **Optimized Movement**: 1.2x speed multiplier for smooth object motion
- **Efficient State Management**: Uses useKV for persistent game state
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of off-screen objects
- **Touch Latency Tracking**: Measures and reports touch response times

## Essential Features

### Target Rain System
- **Continuous Stream**: 2-4 targets spawn every 350ms for optimal density
- **Variable Fall Speeds**: 0.8-2.0 speed range with physics-based movement
- **Performance Throttling**: Smart limits prevent frame rate drops
- **Staggered Positioning**: Objects spawn at different Y positions to prevent overlap

### Player Interaction
- **Multi-touch Support**: Simultaneous play for two players
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate response to correct/incorrect taps
- **Progress Tracking**: Turtle advancement with celebration animations
- **Error Tracking**: All interactions logged for performance analysis

### Level Progression
1. **Fruits & Vegetables**: Recognition and speed focus
2. **Numbers & Shapes**: Mixed category challenge
3. **Alphabet Challenge**: Sequential letter tapping requirement

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Joyful, engaging, and rewarding for young learners
- **Design Personality**: Playful and colorful while maintaining clarity
- **Visual Metaphors**: Race track metaphor with turtle characters climbing upward

### Performance-Focused UI
- **Smooth Animations**: 60fps target with optimized rendering
- **Responsive Touch**: Sub-100ms touch response tracking
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear target display with progress indicators
- **Debug Visibility**: Optional performance overlay for monitoring

### Color Strategy
- **Primary Colors**: Bright, child-friendly palette
- **Performance Indicators**: Color-coded debug information (red for errors, yellow for warnings)
- **Accessibility**: High contrast for clear visibility on large touchscreens

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Architecture
- **React Hooks**: Optimized game logic with useCallback for performance
- **Event System**: Comprehensive tracking for diagnostics and debugging
- **Memory Efficiency**: Automatic cleanup and object limiting
- **Render Optimization**: RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations

### Diagnostic Tools
